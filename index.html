		  <p>It is a novel anyone can fall into. No matter the age or gender. The writing makes you feel like you're in the story. It teaches you to be content with what you have and appreciate it. It takes you through a bitter-sweet journey of fun, terror, love and victory. One of the best fantasy books ever written.Never judge a book by its cover because Coraline is just one of those masterpieces who get judged for their outer covers.Recommend.</p>
